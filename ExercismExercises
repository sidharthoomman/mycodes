Exercism was introduced by a friend as a way to explore and test code running. Here are the tests and my code solutions.
Any feedback is welcome @ sidharthoomman--gmail.com 


Exercise 1: (Easy)
Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".

First we must define a function, then call the function for the function to work. This is the basis of objected oriented programming

#defining the function
def exercise1():
  print("Hello World")

#calling the function
exercises1()
